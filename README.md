## Summary

Metaverse, biggest trends of 2021/2022 and possibly this decade. Even though, the world is continually evolving in every aspect, it is undeniable that Metaverse is the center of attention.

The simulated world which holds the digital asset that ownership can be validated is truly a game-changer for ALL business industries.

On March 25th, 2022, Pichaya Puttekulangkura and Dhibadi Sriuranpong had the opportunity to host a workshop "Into the Metaverse" in the NITAD 18 fair for students from all the leading secondary schools in Thailand. Our workshop includes 2 phases: The explanation and activity workshop

During the explanation, we elaborate on the fundamentals and use-cases of Metaverse to allow the upcoming generation to acknowledge the importance of how the concept of Metaverse is going to create an impact on the future of many business industries.

For the activity workshop, instead of giving out a typical POAP, our aim is to allow the participants to truly experience what's the NFT is like. Hence, we let them become both a creator and the customer, by providing them to choose their artwork and "mint" their first NFT on Polygon Blockchain through our provided smart contract.

## Development

This repository contains two main parts, the frontend directory and the smart contract directory.

Frontend is written using React Typescript with styled components as the sole styling tool and React Three Fiber for 3d models. The website is deployed using Vercel at https://nitad18-nft-workshop.vercel.app/ (Optimized for MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021)

The smart contracts are written using solidity and were deployed to the Polygon Mainnet. The NFT collection can be seen on Opensea at https://opensea.io/collection/nitad18-nft
